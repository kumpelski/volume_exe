## volume_exe
a python script that silences running applications,<br>
the script can then be turned into .exe file using:<br>
<code>pyinstaller --onefile main.py</code>

### my use case
my headphones do not have a volume knob,<br>
using the volume mixer is too slow,<br>
now I can bind .exe launch to a key on my mouse/keyboard
